    "text": "Introduction\nThis is a project to analyze the 2022-2023 season of the top 5 European soccer leagues. We will be using data from the following leagues:\n\nEnglish Premier League (England)\nLigue 1 (France)\nBundesliga (Germany)\nSerie A (Italy)\nLa Liga (Spain)\n\nThe dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains player statistics for the 2022-2023 season. Each observation is a player and the columns contain various statistics such as goals, assists, and minutes played. There are 2,689 total observations and 124 variables. The dataset can be found here. The dataset contains 2022-2023 football player stats per 90 minutes.\nWe are looking to explore the data and answer questions about shots per game across the leagues, and across teams. We will start with some data exploration and then move on to visualizations to answer these questions.\nVariables of interest includee:\n\nPlayer: Name of the player\nNation: Nationality of the player\nPos: Position of the player\nSquad: Team the player plays for\nComp: League the player plays in\nGoals: Number of goals scored by the player\nShots: Number of shots taken by the player per 90 minutes"

We then looked at the average number of shots for a forward or midfielder per game in the top 5 leagues, and displayed the top 20 clubs with the highest average number of shots per game for forwards and midfielders. We found that Serie A has the highest average number of shots per game for forwards and midfielders, while the Bundesliga has the lowest average number of shots per game for forwards and midfielders. We also found that the club with the highest average number of shots per game for forwards and midfielders is Bayern Munich, while the club with the lowest average number of shots per game for forwards and midfielders is Sassuolo.

    "text": "Connection to Class\nIn regards to my class Data Visualization, these visualizations are effective ways of communicating information. I chose not to use all the teams when looking at the average number of shots for a forward or midfielder per game in across teams to avoid the visualization being too cluttered, and allowing the focus to be on the teams. I chose to use a red color for the points and a dark red color for the error bars to make the visualization easier to read. I also chose to use a minimal theme to make the visualization easier to read. I think these visualizations are effective ways of communicating information."

I was also able to create world maps that show the percent change in exports and imports from 2020 to 2021 for all countries in the data set.\nIf I were to have more time, I would like to modify the percent change scale or limit the countries I am looking at to improve the ability to compare different countries, rather than just observing an overall increase across most countries.

This would allow me to see how the trade of goods between countries has changed over time.\n\n\nConnections to Class Ideas\nThis project connects to many of the ideas we have learned in class. I used the mapping features we have learned in class to display the data in a way that is easy to understand. I also used the dplyr package to manipulate the data in a way that made it easier to analyze. I think these visualizations are effective ways of communicating information, but I know that my world maps can be improved upon."

    "text": "Introduction\nI am working with some NBA data containing every shot during the 2022-2023 NBA regular season. There are 217,220 observations in this data set, meaning that there were 217,220 shots taken by players in the NBA in this season.\nI am most interested in the variables:\n\nTEAM_NAME: The name of the team that took the shot\nZONE_NAME: The location on the court where the shot was taken\nSHOT_TYPE: The type of shot taken (2PT or 3PT)\nSHOT_MADE: Whether the shot was made (TRUE) or missed (FALSE)\nQUARTER: The quarter in which the shot was taken\nMINS_LEFT: The number of minutes left in the quarter when the shot was taken\n\nData found at DomSamangy’s GitHub (https://github.com/DomSamangy/NBA_Shots_04_23)\nI am going to use this data to create some visualizations to answer the following questions:\n\nHow were teams 3-pt shooting percentages this season from different areas?\nHow clutch were NBA teams this season?

The top 4 teams from each conference are as follows:\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (East, 1st, 58-24)\nBoston Celtics (East, 2nd, 57-25)\nPhiladelphia 76ers (East, 3rd, 54-28)\nCleveland Cavaliers (East, 4th, 51-31)\nDenver Nuggets (West, 1st, 53-29)\nMemphis Grizzlies (West, 2nd, 51-31)\nSacramento Kings (West, 3rd, 48-34)\nPhoenix Suns (West, 4th, 45-37)\n\n\nnba_3pt_shots &lt;- nba_22_23 |&gt;\n  filter(SHOT_TYPE == \"3PT Field Goal\") |&gt;\n  group_by(TEAM_NAME, ZONE_NAME) |&gt;\n  summarise(shot_perc = mean(SHOT_MADE), .groups = \"drop_last\") |&gt;\n  filter(TEAM_NAME == \"Boston Celtics\" | \n           TEAM_NAME == \"Milwaukee Bucks\" | \n           TEAM_NAME == \"Philadelphia 76ers\" | \n           TEAM_NAME == \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" | \n           TEAM_NAME == \"Denver Nuggets\" | \n           TEAM_NAME == \"Memphis Grizzlies\" | \n           TEAM_NAME == \"Sacramento Kings\" | \n           TEAM_NAME == \"Phoenix Suns\")\n\nggplot(data = nba_3pt_shots, aes(x = TEAM_NAME, y = shot_perc)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\", aes(fill = ZONE_NAME)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"3-Point Shooting Percentages by Location\",\n       subtitle = \"Top 4 Conference Teams from 2022-2023 Season\",\n       x = \"Zone\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Shots Made\",\n       fill = \"Court Position\",\n       caption = \"Data from NBA 2022-2023 Season\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nBack Court 3-pt % is not very important to all basketball teams as it is not a common shot. The most important 3-pt % is the corner 3-pt %, as it is the shortest 3-pt shot. This can be seen in the visualisation above, as the corner 3-pt % is higher for most teams, whether it be the Left Side or the Right Side.\nLet’s look at shooting percentages across teams in the final 3 minutes of the fourth quarter.\n\nclutch_shots &lt;- nba_22_23 |&gt;\n  filter(QUARTER == 4,\n         MINS_LEFT &lt;= 3) |&gt;\n  group_by(TEAM_NAME, SHOT_MADE) |&gt;\n  summarise(n_shots = n(), .groups = \"drop_last\") |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = SHOT_MADE, values_from = n_shots) |&gt;\n  rename(n_made = `TRUE`, n_missed = `FALSE`) |&gt;\n  mutate(n = n_made + n_missed) |&gt;\n  mutate(phat = n_made / n) |&gt;\n  mutate(se = sqrt(phat * (1 - phat) / n),\n         se_lb = phat - se,\n         se_ub = phat + se) |&gt;\n  mutate(TEAM_NAME = fct_reorder(TEAM_NAME, phat))\n\nggplot(data = clutch_shots, aes(x = TEAM_NAME)) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = se_lb, ymax = se_ub), col = \"darkgray\") +\n  geom_point(aes(y = phat), col = \"blue\", size = 2) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Clutch Shooting in the 4th Quarter\",\n       subtitle = \"Final 3 Minutes\",\n       x = \"Team\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Shots Made\",\n       caption = \"Data from NBA 2022-2023 Regular Season\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization above shows the proportion of shots made by each team in the final 3 minutes of the fourth quarter. The error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals for the proportion of shots made. The confidence intervals are quite wide for most teams, which is expected given the small sample sizes for each team in this situation.\n\n\nConclusion and Wrap-Up\nIn conclusion, the visualizations above show that the corner 3-pt % is the most important 3-pt % for most teams, and that the confidence intervals for the proportion of shots made in the final 3 minutes of the fourth quarter are quite wide for most teams. If I had more time to work on this, I would look into creating heat maps for each team based on location of shots taken and whether they were made or missed. This would give a better understanding of where each team is most successful on the court. In DomSamangy’s GitHub, he has a function that creates a map background and this would be a great thing to apply to visualizations.\n\n\nConnections to Class Ideas\nIn regards to my class Data Visualization, these visualizations are effective ways of communicating information. I chose not to use all NBA teams when looking at 3-pt % by location to avoid the visualization being too cluttered, and allowing the focus to be on the location of the shots. I chose to put the teams on the y-axis and order by the proportion of shots made in the final 3 minutes of the fourth quarter when looking at the “clutchness” of teams. This allows the focus to be on the proportion of shots made, and the error bars show the uncertainty in the proportion of shots made. I also chose to use a blue color for the points and a dark gray color for the error bars to make the visualization easier to read. I also chose to use a minimal theme to make the visualization easier to read. I think these visualizations are effective ways of communicating information."
